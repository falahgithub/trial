### 1. Introduction
The Sensor Data Web App is a Python Flask-based web application designed to display and manage sensor data stored in an SQLite database. The app provides a user-friendly interface for viewing sensor data such as temperature, pressure, and humidity, and allows users to add, update, sort, and filter data.


### 2. Installation
